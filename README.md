# MonocularUAV
An extensible framework of monocular SLAM with depth recovery for UAV. 
We put the relevant experiment demonstration video in the paper on Youku website:https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDY2MjQ3ODM0NA==.html?spm=a2hbt.13141534.0.13141534
The depth_ws workspace has completed the task of solving the depth information of the monocular camera and publishing it to the UAV module. This is our innovation.

This is the source code webpage of our latest work on MonocularUAV
. 
The code frame is based on [**ORB_SLAM2**](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)、 
[**AprilTag2**](https://github.com/ManiiXu/Apriltags2_VO)、
[**dji-SDK**](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Onboard-SDK)、
