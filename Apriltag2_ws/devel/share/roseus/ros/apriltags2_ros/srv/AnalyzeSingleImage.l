MSG: sensor_msgs/RegionOfInterest
# This message is used to specify a region of interest within an image.
#
# When used to specify the ROI setting of the camera when the image was
# taken, the height and width fields should either match the height and
# width fields for the associated image; or height = width = 0
# indicates that the full resolution image was captured.

uint32 x_offset  # Leftmost pixel of the ROI
                 # (0 if the ROI includes the left edge of the image)
uint32 y_offset  # Topmost pixel of the ROI
                 # (0 if the ROI includes the top edge of the image)
uint32 height    # Height of ROI
uint32 width     # Width of ROI

# True if a distinct rectified ROI should be calculated from the \"raw\"
# ROI in this message. Typically this should be False if the full image
# is captured (ROI not used), and True if a subwindow is captured (ROI
# used).
